I am a 3rd- year Ph.D. student at Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am a part-time Research Assistant at the **Biomedical Modeling, Visualization, and Image-guided Navigation (BiMVisIGN)** Lab. My current research interest focuses on Medical Image Analysis for Cardiac Applications using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. I completed my Master's in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota Duluth, MN, USA, and my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh.
