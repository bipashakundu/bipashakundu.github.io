I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Imaging Science with a focus on Medical Image Analysis using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Currently, I am also a Research Assistant at BiMVisIGN Lab. I have experienced developing and fine- tuning deep learning for multi-modal medical images to improve automatic semantic and instance segmentation accuracy, and deformable registrations. I completed my MSEE from University of Minnesota Duluth, USA and undergrad from Khulna University of engineering & technology, Bangladesh.
