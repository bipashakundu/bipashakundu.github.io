excerpt: "<br/><img src='/images/vis_2.JPG'>
Non-rigid surface-based soft tissue registration is vital for surgical navigation, enabling the integration of pre-operative and intra-operative images for real-time visualization in a common coordinate system. Despite its potential, challenges like complex surface structures and degrees of freedom hinder widespread adoption. This study compares several open-source liver registration algorithms, highlighting the Gaussian Mixture Model-Finite Element Model (GMM-FEM) as the most robust, with consistently lower post-registration errors under reduced visibility and increased surface deformation. This method offers a promising solution for improving surgical navigation accuracy.
